<h3> Background: </h3>
<p>The Survey devil application allows a user to create their own survey or take other user surveys. Survey responses must use a 1-5 scale, and these responses are collected in a dashboard that shows the total for each category.
</p>
<h3> Technologies Used: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Atom Editor</li>
  <li>AJAX</li>
  <li>Boostrap</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Handlebars</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>SASS</li>
</ul>
<h3> Project Description & Planning Process </h3>
<p> After a user signs up and signs in, they are able to create a survey or take a survey. A registered user can keep track of their surveys by clicking on the "View My Surveys" button. Additionally, a user can view all surveys by clicking the "View My Surveys" button. The user has the capability of updating or deleting their own surveys, but not those created by other users.
</p>
<h3> Wireframes & User Stories</h3>
<p> The developers utilized white boarding for organization and planning purposes:

<h5>User Stories</h5>
<ul>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to sign up, sign in, and take a survey.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to view the results of a survey in a dashboard.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to create a survey and see the results of that survey.</li>
  <li>As a user, I don't want to be able to edit or delete another person's survey.</li>
  <li>As a user, I don't want empty responses on a survey unless specified as an option.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to be able to create surveys with different question types.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Next Steps: </h3>
<p>Next steps in this application would be to allow greater customization in the categories for survey responses.  Future work on the app would also clean up the UI to provide a better user experience interacting with the surveys.  Modifications to the dashboard could include more statitistics. For example, percentages for each category.  In order to create a more interesting dashboard, future development could consider adding bar graphs (potentially incorporating other npm packages) or other interesting visual displays.</p>
